The input fields would be
* Weight: 
* (K)g or (L)bs: 
  * the desired output weight unit
  * user can use either capital or simple letters to indicate the desired conversion
    * e.g.:   K, k, L or l

Once the output weight is calculated / converted according to the conversion requested, 
display the output as follows:
* If output weight is in Kg
  * Weight in Kg: [calculated_weight]
* If output weight is in lbs'
  * Weight in Lbs: [calculated_weight]
